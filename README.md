Built a full-stack project called Streamify, similar to YouTube, using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
The application supports complete user authentication, including user registration and login using JWT, along with features like logout, password change, and username update.
During registration, users can upload an avatar image and an optional cover image using Multer, and all media files are stored and served efficiently using Cloudinary. Users can also update their avatar and cover images through dedicated APIs.
The platform allows users to view their channel’s subscriber count, see how many channels they are subscribed to, and access their watch history, providing a personalized user experience.
